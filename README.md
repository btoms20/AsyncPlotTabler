# AsyncPlotTabler
Prebuilt Tabler Components for Async HTML Rendering in Vapor

#### What's [Plot](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Plot)?
> Plot, a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing type-safe HTML, XML and RSS in Swift. It can be used to build websites, documents and feeds, as a templating tool, or as a renderer for higher-level components and tools. It‚Äôs primary focus is on static site generation and Swift-based web development.

#### What's [Tabler](https://github.com/tabler/tabler)?
> Tabler is fully responsive and compatible with all modern browsers. Thanks to its modern and user-friendly design you can create a fully functional interface that users will love! Choose the layouts and components you need and customize them to make your design consistent and eye-catching. Every component has been created with attention to detail to make your interface beautiful! 

#### What's [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor)?
> Vapor is an HTTP web framework for Swift. It provides a beautifully expressive and easy-to-use foundation for your next website, API, or cloud project.

### When we combine these three powerful technologies, something revolutionary[^1] happens...
